# rlabs-flyway-maven

##### Version 0.0.1

Flyway Maven Project.<br>
This is an example how to work with database migrations with [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/).<br>

It's based on PostgreSQL database-server, then you should check if the server is up and running.<br>
By the way, the Flyway doesn't create the database, its need to be created outside, as well as setting the username and password for the owner of the data resource. In the future, you can easily switch this example to make use of another database by setting up the correct JDBC driver and Connection URL.<br>

## Execution 

For execute, simple follow the statement:<br>

$ mvn clean compile flyway:migrate<br>
$ mvn clean compile flyway:info
<br><br>
More details can be found on [Flyway Documentation](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/).<br>

## Requirements

- Java 1.8 or later.
